This is the implementation of a q-gram based index for patterns of limited length.
For a text T of length n, 
this index requires (n/k+sigma^q)log(n/k)+O(sigma^q log sigma) bits,
where sigma is the alphabet size, and q and k are parameters.
The pattern length must be less than or equal to q-k+1.
After we construct this index for T,
we can add any characters to the end of T.

To build: make

It generates the library in the file "sdci.a"

To use: To use the library, please compile your main program along with
the file "sdci.a". See for example the case of file "example.cpp" in 
"makefile".
